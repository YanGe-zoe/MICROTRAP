# Research on Laser-Induced Forward Transfer Single-Cell Live Sorting Technology Based on Impregnated Modified Protective Microtrap
•	The functionalised microwell array-based laser ejection sorting method overcame key challenges of LIFT, including cell viability loss on dried substrates, low capture efficiency, laser-induced damage, poor sorting precision, and analysis instability due to cell stacking in liquid environments.

•	Designed a functionalised microwell array chip integrating hydrophobic pores on Parylene C, a superhydrophilic metal layer, and a glass substrate, achieving stable droplet encapsulation and single-cell capture rates of 86.3% (microbial) and 81.8% (tumor)

•	Developed a multiphysics-coupled laser–micropore model to quantify laser–structure interaction, confining thermal diffusion within 3 μm to preserve cell viability.

•	Integrated the micropore array with LIFT to enable high-efficiency single-cell sorting, maintaining viabilities of 96.5% (microbial) and 79.2% (tumor).
